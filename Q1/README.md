# ENSE 370 Winter 2020 Midterm Exam - Question 1

**PROMPT:** Consider a library book inventory system. The system has the following functionalities:
1. Add a new book (for a system administrator)
2. Search for a book (both user and system administrator)
3. Remove a book (system administrator only)

Note that before a book is removed from the system, the system must check that the book has been returned (i.e. not on loan).

PART A: Draw the Use-Case diagram.

PART B: Suppose the library book inventory system has the following components:
1. Text Input Module - for user to type in search information
2. Menu-based Input Module - for user to select book information for search
3. Display Module - for displaying the selected book information

A user can only interact with the library book inventory system through the above modules. Draw the Class diagram including associations and multiplicities to users of the system. There is no need to include the system administrator.
